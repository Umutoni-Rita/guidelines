# Software Technical Documentation Guidelines

As a software team, we must ensure our technical documentation is **clear, consistent, and easy to maintain**.  
This document defines the structure, style, and best practices for writing and maintaining software technical documentation.

---

## 1. General Principles

- Documentation is part of the software – keep it up to date.
- Write for developers, testers, and maintainers – not just yourself.
- Keep content **simple, concise, and structured**.
- Use **Markdown (.md)** format unless otherwise specified.

---

## 2. Documentation Structure

Each project should include at least the following sections:

1. **Overview**
   - Short description of the project.
   - High-level architecture diagram (if applicable).

2. **Installation**
   - System requirements.
   - Step-by-step installation instructions.

3. **Configuration**
   - Environment variables.
   - Configuration files and their purpose.

4. **Usage**
   - Commands to run the application.
   - Example API calls or UI instructions.

5. **Architecture**
   - Main components and their responsibilities.
   - Data flow or integration diagrams.

6. **Development**
   - How to set up a development environment.
   - Branching and version control strategy.
   - Coding standards and conventions.

7. **Testing**
   - Running unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
   - Test data guidelines.

8. **Deployment**
   - Deployment steps (manual or automated).
   - CI/CD pipeline description.

9. **Troubleshooting**
   - Common errors and fixes.
   - Logs location and interpretation.

10. **License & References**
    - License type (MIT, GPL, proprietary, etc.).
    - External references, APIs, and libraries.

## 3. Writing Style

- Use **headings (#, ##, ###)** to organize content.
- Use **code blocks** for commands, configs, or code samples:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
- Use **lists** (bullet points or numbered) for steps or items.
- Use **bold** and *italic* for emphasis.
- Use **links** to reference other documentation or external resources.
- Use **images** to illustrate concepts or diagrams.

## 4. Tools and Technologies

- **Markdown**: For writing documentation.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **GitHub**: For hosting documentation repositories.
- **shadcn/ui**: For UI components and styling.
- **Next.js**: For building the documentation portal.
